# Vehicle Route Calculaton
The program was created in the course of Applied Power Electronics in the Automotive Industry at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology in Osijek. The program allows the user to enter the desired route for the movement of the autonomous vehicle and to calculate the parameters: speed[m/s], distance[m] and the time required for the vehicle to pass the given route.

## How to run the app
1. To run this application you need some form of environment to run C code
2. The application is written as Console app with the help of which the entire communication takes place
3. Recommended environment: Visual studio

## How to use it 
1. At the beginning, the program requires entering a key number of points
2. After entering the number of key points, the program creates route stages. For each stage, it is necessary to enter the distance, followed by the selection of actions for individual stages
3. As a result, the program returns the created route with calculated values
